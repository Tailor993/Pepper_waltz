# Pepper waltz project
## Description
This is a semester homework assignment at [Óbuda University - Alba Regia Technical Faculty](http://www.amk.uni-obuda.hu/index.php/en). In this assignment We need to creat some application, which is controlling [Softbank Robotics - Pepper Robot](https://www.softbankrobotics.com/emea/en/pepper). 

We decided to write a program, which is bring to life the Viennese Waltz.
We have only 1 robot at Székesfehervár, Hungary, so the time was very limited. This is the reason why We used the default IDE and a lot of  drag'n'drop block programing. (Therefore, we apologize to you dear reader.)

The robot is owned by the [Alba Innovár](https://albainnovar.hu/eng) thank you for them help.
